Instructions to bump the version of q in homebrew

1. Sync your fork with homebrew original fork

	git checkout master

	git pull upstream master

	git push origin master

2. Create a branch for the version bump

	git checkout -b q<version-number>

3. Edit the file Library/Formula/q.rb.

	a. Change the url to the new tar.gz file

	b. Change the sha256 checksum

		$ curl -sL "https://github.com/harelba/q/archive/<version>.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256
		<checksum> -

		$ Change the checksum in q.rb's "sha256" line to the new checksum

	c. Verify by running the following:

		$ brew fetch -s q

		The output should show the new SHA256 without any warning

4. Check the diff

	git diff | vi -

5. Commit the change as "q <version>"

6. Push it as a separate branch to your repository:

	git push origin q<version-number>

7. Go the homebrew fork in github, and press "compare and pull-request" on the just-pushed branch

8. Review the diff and make sure that the pull-request is from <fork>/<branch> to homebrew/master (should be the default)

9. Press "create pull-request" button

10. If everything is fine, you'll be confirmed after several hours
